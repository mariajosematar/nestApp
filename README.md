## Introduction

Welcome to Nestapp, a backend application built with NestJS, the powerful Node.js framework. 
I'm attempting to start establishing my career and at the same time creating how-to guides to get started in the world of back-end developers. In the case of the following code, it is essentially the creation of a REST API, which allows seamless communication between client applications and a database. of data.

## Project Overview

I have worked to develop a piece of code that performs correctly and that in turn is not too complex in its syntax for someone who is just beginning release. NestJS simplifies backend development and how it fits into the Node.js ecosystem.


## Running in Production

To run the code in a production environment, execute the following command:

### npm start
